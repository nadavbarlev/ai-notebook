Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Kubernetes works by grouping containers into logical units called pods. These pods can be managed and scheduled across a cluster of machines.

A key feature of Kubernetes is self-healing. If a container crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it. If a machine goes down, it moves the workload to another machine.

Kubernetes can automatically scale applications up or down based on demand. It monitors performance and adjusts resources as needed.

It also supports load balancing, service discovery, and secret management. Developers can describe how their app should run in a YAML file, and Kubernetes takes care of the rest.

Many organizations use Kubernetes to simplify infrastructure management and make their applications more reliable and scalable.
